### Monday, December 2, 2024

I woke up at 5:40 got up and started working at 6:00.
I encountered some 500 errors. I had a hard time solving this
puzzle especially the second part. I am not sure whether I am
going to continue.

See further [Day 2](Day02.md).

### Tuesday, December 3, 2024

I did not wake-up early and decided to have a look at the
puzzle around 7:45 when I was preparing and eating my breakfast.
After that I decided to give it a try and it went quite
smoothly, maybe also because I decided not trying to finish
as quickly as possible.

I started around 6:00 and found the answers rather easily.
