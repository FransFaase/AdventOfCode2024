# AdventOfCode2024

My effort for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) contest.
All times are for Central European Timezone (CET).

I am going to use [MarkDownC](https://github.com/FransFaase/IParse/?tab=readme-ov-file#markdownc)
again, like I did in the past years. MarkDownC is a tool for
performing literatie programming with MarkDown files. It parses one
or more MarkDown files and outputs all the fragments of C code found
in those files, rearranging them such that all the definitions are placed
in an order that can be compiled. When a certain function is repeated,
the last version is put in the output.

### Sunday, December 1, 2024

I woke up at 5:40 got up and started working at 6:00.

See further [Day 1](Day01.md).

### Monday, December 2, 2024

I woke up at 5:40 got up and started working at 6:00.
I encountered some 500 errors. I had a hard time solving this
puzzle especially the second part. I am not sure whether I am
going to continue.

See further [Day 2](Day02.md).

### Tuesday, December 3, 2024

I did not wake-up early and decided to have a look at the
puzzle around 7:45 when I was preparing and eating my breakfast.
After that I decided to give it a try and it went quite
smoothly, maybe also because I decided not trying to finish
as quickly as possible.

See further [Day 3](Day03.md).

### Wednesday, December 4, 2024

I started around 6:00 and found the answers rather easily.

### Thursday, December 5, 2024

I started around 6:00 and found the answers rather easily.

See further [Day 5](Day05.md).

### Friday, December 6, 2024

I only started working on the puzzle in the evening at 21:21.
Took me about an hour to find both answers. For the second
part I did implement the correct algorithm but I made a small
bug that required some debugging using the example input.

See further [Day 6](Day06.md).

### Saturday, December 7, 2024

I started around 6:17, because I fell asleep again after
my alarm went of. It went quite smooth except for the usual
struggle with large numbers. I used `__int128`, but it might
have worked with `long long`.

See further [Day 7](Day07.md).

### Sunday, December 8, 2024

I started at 6:00. Only compiled my code three times to find
the two solutions. The second was because I had not realized
that the towers were also to be counted. Only needed a very
small change to fix that.

See further [Day 8](Day08.md).

### Monday, December 9, 2024

I started at 6:00. It took me almost three hours to solve
both puzzles.
